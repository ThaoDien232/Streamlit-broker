## Brokerage MCP Integration Summary

### Overview
- Implemented `utils/brokerage_mcp.BrokerageMCP`, a lightweight tool registry that mirrors the banking MCP pattern with 5-minute caching and JSON-friendly outputs.
- Added `pages/8_Brokerage_Chatbot.py`, a Streamlit chat interface that leverages OpenAI chat completions, executes tool calls iteratively, and records execution history.
- Excluded the earnings driver capability per request; all other planned tools are live.

### Available Tools
- `get_data_availability`: Returns latest actual quarter, annual coverage, and forecast years from `BrokerageMetrics`.
- `get_broker_info`: Lists supported tickers or details availability ranges for requested brokers.
- `query_historical_data`: Pulls quarterly or annual metrics with optional period/metric filters and group shortcuts.
- `query_forecast_data`: Serves forecast metrics (ACTUAL=0) for requested brokers and key income lines.
- `get_valuation_analysis`: Computes percentile-based valuation statistics using the SQL-backed valuation dataset.
- `get_stock_performance`: Fetches price performance between two dates via the TCBS public API.
- `get_commentary`: Generates OpenAI commentary for a broker-quarter using existing financial loaders.

### Key Behaviors
- Tool outputs are cached for 5 minutes based on sorted argument signatures to reduce duplicate queries.
- Tool specs feed directly into the OpenAI `tools` schema, enabling automatic multi-tool reasoning.
- Tool execution logs are stored in Streamlit session state for transparency and debugging.
- Model selection reads from `OPENAI_MODEL` env var or `[openai] model` secret, defaulting to `gpt-4o-mini`.

### Next Steps & Considerations
- Add sector-tier aggregations once supporting tables are available.
- Extend `get_commentary` with richer context (market share, prop book) when data sources are exposed.
- Introduce throttling or pagination for large historical queries if user feedback indicates latency issues.
- Consider a dedicated valuation trend tool when broader metrics (e.g., EV/EBITDA) become consistent across brokers.
