# Work Log – Forecast Page Iteration

## Pages Updated
- `pages/4_Forecast.py`
- `pages/2_Charts.py`
- `utils/brokerage_codes.py`

## Brokerage Segment (Forecast Page)
- Added full-quarter HSX market-share pull via `fetch_market_share_quarter` and brokerage-code mapping (`utils/brokerage_codes.py`).
- Integrated debug toggle showing API rows, matched broker code, API share, turnover fallback, and final value.
- Simplified brokerage table to four rows; removed source indicator and fallback warning.

## Margin Lending Segment (Forecast Page)
- **In-progress:** Began adding helper functions to extract IS/BS quarterly values and compute margin metrics (balance, rate, income, borrowing, interest rate, expense).
- Inserted UI controls for margin balance and lending rate, with automatic borrowing-balance adjustment and quarterly income/expense math (balance × rate ÷ 4).
- Updated summary and segment input logic to incorporate margin forecasts.
- **Blocking Issue:** Automatic string replacement introduced malformed code (missing newlines/escaped characters). Current file does not compile—needs clean reinsert of the margin segment.

## Market Share Tab (Charts Page)
- Switched UI to “most recent N quarters”; default 6.
- Column titles now use full period labels (e.g., `2025 Q2`).
- Normalized quarter parsing for HSX response strings (e.g., `"Q2"`).
- Robust percentage formatting for table columns.

## Outstanding Tasks
- Reinsert margin segment in `pages/4_Forecast.py` cleanly (remove malformed block and add final implementation).
- Wire margin forecast values into summary table once code compiles.
